Markdown Citations (MC) is a tool that allows you to define citations in a Markdown document by name and have them converted into numerical markers. For example, given two files - `report.md` and `citations.txt`, the following output can be generated.

<details><summary>Sample input and output from MC</summary>

#### `report.md`

```markdown
<!-- c:source=citations.txt -->

# Hello!

This is a statement. Statements can be classified based on their purpose[r:wikip-statement].

Statement can also refer to a part of an imperative programming language that expresses an action to be carried out[r:statement-cs].

## References

<!-- c:footer -->
```

#### `citations.txt`

```
wikip-statement: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statement
statement-cs: https://www.webopedia.com/definitions/statement/ What is Statement? | Webopedia
```

#### `report.gen.md` (generated by MC)

```markdown

## Installing

Markdown Citations can be installed using `go get`.

```
go get -u github.com/codemicro/markdown-citations/cmd/mdcite
```

The, assuming `GOPATH/bin` is on your `PATH`, run `mdcite <source document>` (eg `mdcite document.md`)

## Usage

### Adding a source for citations

A source can be included in a given Markdown file by including the following line: `<!-- c:source=<filename> -->`, replacing filename with a path to a text file relative to your document.

You can have multiple of these in one document in any location, including on the same line.

### Defining citations

Once you've added a citation source, you can begin defining citations in that file.

Each line in one of these files can be one of three things:

* Blank
* A line starting with `#`, which denotes it as a comment -anything on of these lines is ignored
* A line in the form `citation-name: https://www.example.com`, with an optional citation title following that

The citation name is what you'll use to refer to this citation in your document.

### Referring to citation

When writing your document, you can include a citation by using the following: `[r:citation-name]`. These can be placed anywhere in a document, and will automatically be converted into a numbered link. The citation name is case insensitive.

### Including an index of citations

Optionally, you can include a numbered list of citations in your document by including the following line: `<!-- c:footer -->`. This can be inserted anywhere in a document an unlimited amount of times. Every usage of this will be replaced by a footer containing all references and their titles.
